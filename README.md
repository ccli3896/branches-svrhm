# branches-svrhm
Code for SVRHM 2021 submission

The Plots notebook makes figures out of the uploaded data.
To make the Gabor datasets, run gen_gabors.py.
To run the models, use scripts Expt1a.py, Expt1b.py, Expt2a.py, Expt2b.py, Expt3.py. These correspond to Figures 2, 3, and 4 respectively. All require PyTorch.
Run the 'a' files before the 'b' files.

# Predicting task allocation in branched architectures
Code for SVRHM 2021 submission

The Plots notebook makes figures out of the uploaded data.

To make the Gabor datasets, run gen_gabors.py.

To run the models, use scripts 
1. Expt1a.py
2. Expt1b.py
3. Expt2a.py
4. Expt2b.py
5. Expt3.py. 

Experiments 1, 2, and 3 correspond to Figures 2, 3, and 4 respectively. All used PyTorch 1.8 to make figures.
Run the 'a' files before the 'b' files.
